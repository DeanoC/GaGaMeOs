# GaGaMeOs

WORK IN PROGRESS
This doesn't do anything yet, just creates a dummy baremetal riscv test app passing through the toolchain

Seperate GaGaMeOs_generate_compiler repo that uses docker and scripts to generate linux and windows bare metal compiler (for riscv at the moment but will support arm soon)
